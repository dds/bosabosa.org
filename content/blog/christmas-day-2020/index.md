Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone. What a terrible year 2020 has
been for everyone. I'm incredibly thankful for the people in my life and all of
the relative comfort and stability I've been able to have this year.

I want to say to everyone with an empty space in their family where a loved one
should be, I'm sorry. Chances are, you feel lonely but are not alone. I hope you
find healing. You're due to enjoy simple pleasures, whatever you enjoy. Just
please, don't hurt yourself, drink lots of water, and try to go to bed early.

My dad passed away of cancer on Christmas morning last year, 2019. In April of
that year, he suffered strokes which occurred following surgery for a broken leg
due to the cancer's metastasizes. My dad's strokes happened while I was out of
work and was between surgeries on both hands for carpal tunnel syndrome. I'd
been fired from my job after claiming that the carpal tunnel syndrome was work
related.

This year, I'm grateful to my team at work for all the big and small help
they've given me and each other through the pandemic and my personal loss. And
thank you to all who provide compassion to those grieving.
