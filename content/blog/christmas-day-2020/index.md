Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone. What a terrible year 2020 has been for humanity. I'm incredibly thankful for the people in my life and all the comfort and stability I've been able to have this year. 

My dad passed away on Christmas morning last year, pre covid. Neither he nor I are Christians, but we celebrate the holiday. I want to say to everyone with an empty space in their family where a loved one should be, we can heal through sharing our grief.

Thank you to everyone for your compassion to all of us who have lost loved ones. Hoping 2021 is a much better year.
