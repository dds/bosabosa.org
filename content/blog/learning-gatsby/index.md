I'm building this site in [Gatsby] because I want the advantages of a static
website with great frontend integration and `git push` to deploy.

## Why?

Why do this at all? Right now, we are surrounded by crises. There's the climate
crisis, the pandemic crisis, the poverty crisis, the economic crisis, the social
crisis, and more. Well, this part of me [taking action][climateaction.tech] by
moving my website to green software engineering and sustainable product design
built on [free and open-source software].

## What's [Gatsby]?

[Gatsby] is a framework and ecosystem of plugins that brings together the best
of web development in a neat package. It's the [Doom Emacs] of JavaScript. The
framework is built around combining [React] with [GraphQL] for building a
in-browser experiences.

## What Makes [Gatsby] So Great?

Gatsby brings it all together:

- Free and open-source (MIT license).
- Static website served from the edge, shared infrastructure and minimal resource consumption. So cheap, it's free!
- Built on React so building the user interface is a breeze.
- GraphQL for integrating data, decoupling the data sources from the way they are used in the experience.
- Plugins bring all the features from other frameworks.
